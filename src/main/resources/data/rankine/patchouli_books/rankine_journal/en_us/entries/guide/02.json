Most ores other than gems from this stage on will need to be crushed into their mineral component and used in a Blast Furnace. Perhaps the most important ore rock at this stage is $(world/deposits#ironstone)Ironstone$(), which is an early source of iron. "

If you want to progress quickly then the best option is to find and crush $(l:world/meteorites)Meteorite Ores$(). Otherwise, you can spend some time mining the new ores available to you. However, mining for ores isn't the only way to get certain resources. Stone blocks near certain ores will have a chance to drop a nugget from that ore when mined. This is the alternative way to get nickel for invar and other elements that can improve basic alloy tools (hint: challenge advancement for making a harvest level 2 bronze pick). "

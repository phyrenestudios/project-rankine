To simulate this phenomena, the sediment fan will cause nearby areas to collect sediment. Place a water source block that has room to flow out 3 blocks at least. Place the sediment fan under the water source block and each random tick a random sedimentary stone will be generated 3 blocks downstream. Using additional sediment blocks in the two blocks under the water and next to the fan can allow for specific stone generation."
